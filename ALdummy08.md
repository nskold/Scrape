The Scrape repository contains a scoop of partial scores.

---
The Scrape repository is a read/write area for developers.
The initial developer is Arthur Lenskold (AL).
A goal is to have the Scrape repository with some sub-repositories,
and for the Scrape repository to have one parent repository, Team_d2scor.

---
The Scrape repository is a mainstream niche.
It is a niche because it assigns a unique page number and suffix index
to the .musicxml source code of each mainstream score.
( See the Tempo_FunctionalSpecifications file in the Memos repository ).

This unique page number serves as a database index for a Volpiano protocol
that is included in the cantus.org index representation for both
melody and lyrics.

The Scrape repository may contain neither melody nor lyrics.

A secondary purpose of the Scrape repository is to assign both a title and
a subtitle to each mainstream score.
English title assignments must come from the Gregorian Missal ( Solesmes ).

The Scrape repository corrects the numbering of psalms.
This is because the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops ( Bible )
website is intended to be relevant for the Scrape repository.
  
The Gregorian Missal melodies often accommodate only a B flat.
Alternatively, some melodies have no flats.
This niche is for those scores that possibly require a chromatic transpose.
